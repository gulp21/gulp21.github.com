DejaVuSansHalfStar.ttf
===============================================================================

                         Computer Modern Unicode fonts

   Computer Modern Unicode fonts were converted from metafont sources
   using mftrace with autotrace backend and fontforge. Some characters
   in several fonts are copied from Blue Sky type 1 fonts released by
   AMS. Their main purpose is to create free good quality fonts for use
   in X applications supporting many languages. Currently the fonts
   contain glyphs from Latin (Metafont ec, tc, vnr), Cyrillic (lh), Greek
   (cbgreek when available) code sets and IPA extensions (from tipa).
   Other alphabets are also welcome.

   These fonts are distributed under the terms of Open Font License. Some
   scripts for font generation are distributed under the terms
   of GNU General Public License.

   This font set contains 33 fonts. You can download from homepage the
   sfd files and pfb fonts. It is better to use these fonts with
   antialiasing enabled.

   Of cause, this version has many unresolved questions and bugs. If you
   have found any bug inform me by e-mail.

   Thanks to George Williams the author of the fontforge for his
   responsiveness in fixing bugs and adding new features.
